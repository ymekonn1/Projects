This project was part of CS50's Introduction to Artificial Intelligence with Python course on edX. 
In this project I implemented an AI for a game of tictactoe. The AI uses the MinMax algorithm to make
the best move at a given time. runner.py and the skeleton for tictactoe.py were provided by the CS50 team.
The program requires the pygame module to run, and to run the game use python runner.py command.
